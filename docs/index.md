# Welcome to VPX Game Logic Framework

This project is a framework for making original virtual pinball tables using the [VPX](https://github.com/vpinball/vpinball) platform.
It is based on [The Mission Pinball Framework](https://missionpinball.org) for real and homebrew machines. Many of the game logic commands mirror the MPF commands as one of the goals of this project is to have an interchangeable config between vpx and mpf. Another goal of this project is to have a standalone set of game logic devices that doesn't not require the end user to install and run the mpf bridge for vpx.

## Installation
